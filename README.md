# 🐇 White Rabbit

In stories, the White Rabbit appears twice:  
once to pull Alice into wonder,  
and once to guide Neo toward the truth.

This isn’t a project or a destination.  
It’s an invitation by the same kind they received.

An invitation to look a little closer.  
To follow the small things that feel meaningful for no obvious reason.  
To choose curiosity over certainty, even for a moment.

If you’ve reached this page, maybe you’re already stepping off the familiar path.

No pressure.  
No promises.  
Just a chance to see where the trail leads.

There’s only one rule:

**Follow the White Rabbit.**
